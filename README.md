# libip

## This library is just a small utility for performing simple IP address calculations

#### Run the install.sh script by typing 
      `sudo sh install.sh` 
#### to install the library globally or just type 
      `sh build.sh` 
#### to get the shared object in the directory itself.

#### For compiling programs using libip include the header file ip.h like this 
      `#include <ip/ip.h>` 
#### and compile your C file using 
      `gcc main.c -lip`

##### IP makeIP(char* ip)
makeIP function takes in a character array and gives out an IP struct,this function is used to initialize an IP variable.
Example: `IP ip = makeIP("192.168.14.210")`


##### void printIP(IP ip)
As the name suggests printIP function prints the ip stored in the IP struct passed to it

##### void setSubnet(IP \*ip,char \*subnet)

The above function sets the subnet for the IP struct passed to it and also calculates the network and broadcast address for the given IP address and subnet.

##### void getDetails(IP ip);

The above function prints the IP address, subnet mask, network address and broadcast address stored in the IP struct passed to it. This method should always be called after calling setSubnet with a valid subnet address.
